// Delivery tool-calling for the AI chat path (Fase 2): search the menu,
// inspect one product's customization options, add to cart, view the
// cart, correct/remove a cart line, calculate the delivery fee, and
// place the order. update_cart_item (added 2026-08-21) is the one
// mutation that can shrink or clear the cart — everything else here
// only ever adds.
//
// Every tool re-validates any id the model hands it against
// `ctx.accountId` before touching the database (never trust an id or a
// price coming from the model — same "defense in depth" principle
// already used by `automations/engine.ts`'s `create_deal`), and reuses
// the exact query shapes the Flow-based `add_order_item`/`order_summary`
// nodes already use (`loadProductWithAddonGroups`, `getAccountCurrency`
// in src/lib/flows/engine.ts) rather than re-deriving them.
//
// Addon groups (delivery_addon_groups) are account-defined and product-
// type-agnostic — "Size" for a pizzeria, "Ponto da carne" for a burger
// joint, "Cobertura" for an açaí shop, whatever a given business set
// up. get_product_details surfaces whatever groups/options that
// PARTICULAR account configured for that PARTICULAR product; nothing
// here assumes any specific business vertical. add_to_cart enforces
// `is_required` server-side (same rule the button-driven Flow engine
// already enforces — see engine.ts's addon-group step) rather than
// only hinting at it in a tool description, so a required choice can't
// be silently skipped just because the model forgot to ask.

    // same product, but the existing line was added bare (no notes,
    // no addon choices) and this call is quantity 1 with some detail
    // to attach. Confirmed live (2026-08-07): a customer said "1
    // marmita P" (added bare, no notes), then in the next message
    // described how they wanted it prepared ("sem carne, com ovo
    // frito, sem macarrão") — the model, with no memory of the first
    // call, re-called add_to_cart with that as `notes`. Without this,
    // the two calls (notes "" vs notes "sem carne...") don't match the
    // exact check above, so they became two separate 1x lines — R$20
    // x 2 shown as R$40 for what was really one R$20 marmita.
    // Confirmed live again (2026-09-05, Ezequiel), this time with an
    // addon instead of notes: "E um refrigerante lata" (added bare, no
    // flavor), then "Coca cola" a few seconds later — same shape, just
    // addon_option_ids instead of notes, and the original version of
    // this match (keyed only on `item.notes`) never even looked at
    // that case, so it fell straight to a second line every time.
    //
    // Caught by code review right after that fix (not a live incident
    // yet — closing the gap before it becomes one): the match below
    // used to require the candidate line to be untouched on BOTH notes
    // AND addons. That means a line could only ever receive ONE such
    // clarification, ever — the moment the Ezequiel fix above attaches
    // a flavor, the line has addons=[Coca cola] and is no longer
    // "bare", so a customer who then sends a THIRD message ("sem
    // gelo") would fail this match and get a genuine duplicate line
    // again, just one message later. Now each dimension is only
    // required to still be blank if THIS call is the one supplying it
    // — a call bringing only notes only needs notes still blank
    // (whatever addons the line already has from an earlier attach are
    // irrelevant to it), and vice versa for a call bringing only
    // addons. A call bringing both still requires both blank, same as
    // before.
    //
    // This ONLY fires when the model explicitly says so
    // (attach_note_to_existing: true) — it used to auto-detect this
    // from cart shape alone (same product/addons + an empty-notes
    // line), which is exactly what silently ATE an item in a different
    // live incident (2026-08-27, Fernanda Mendonça): the customer
    // listed 3 marmitas in one message — one plain, one "sem
    // macarrão", one a different size — and the model's second
    // add_to_cart call (for the "sem macarrão" one) got auto-merged
    // into the first (plain) line's notes instead of becoming its own
    // line. The customer paid for 3 marmitas; only 2 reached the
    // kitchen. Both incidents look identical from inside this
    // function (same product, an empty-notes/empty-addons line sitting
    // there, a quantity-1 call with a detail arriving) — there is no
    // way to tell "customer is describing the one item they already
    // ordered" from "customer just listed a second, differently-
    // customized unit of the same product" without the model's own
    // knowledge of which one it actually is. Defaulting to NOT
    // merging (create a new line) is the safer failure: an extra line
