/**
 * Sweep abandoned `ai_cart`s across every account.
 *
 * Confirmed live (2026-08-28, Churrascaria Concórdia — Edemar and
 * Ezequiel, same day): when a conversation's cart never turns into a
 * real order (the AI stalls, hands off, or the customer just goes
 * quiet), `ai_cart` sits there forever — nothing ever clears it on its
 * own. The next time that same contact orders, sometimes days or
 * weeks later, whatever was left over is still sitting in the same
 * cart: an old line silently doubles a new one via the exact-match
 * merge guard (Ezequiel — see isStaleCartLine/create-order.ts), or
 * unrelated leftover items just ride along into the next order's
 * summary as if the customer asked for them (Fernanda — 3 items
 * confirmed for a single "uma marmita P sem macarrão" request).
 *
 * This sweep is the general fix behind those two point patches: any
 * cart where NOTHING has been touched inside the staleness window
 * (isCartAbandoned — same 6h threshold add_to_cart's own merge guard
 * uses, so "stale" means one consistent thing everywhere) gets reset
 * to `[]` outright, account-wide. A cart with any recent activity is
 * left completely alone — this only ever clears sessions that are
 * genuinely abandoned, never an order actively in progress.
 *
 * `ai_order_info` (customer name, address, payment method) is
 * deliberately NOT touched here — unlike cart lines, stale contact
 * details are still usually correct on the next order and saving the
 * AI from re-asking is a real convenience, not a bug.
 *
 * Auth: re-uses AUTOMATION_CRON_SECRET, same reasoning as
 * flows/cron/route.ts — one shared secret for every low-frequency
 * background sweep in this codebase, each still on its own URL so one
 * failing doesn't block the others.
 *
 * Hosting: hit on a schedule (Vercel Cron / GitHub Actions / external
 * pinger). Every 5 minutes matches the other sweeps here — comfortably
 * inside the 6h staleness window, so an abandoned cart gets cleared
 * long before anyone's next visit, without ever racing a cart that's
 * still actively being built.
